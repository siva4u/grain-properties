# grain-properties
This Software estimates granular properties such as tortuosity, porosity and co-ordination number from granular particles position data from discrete element method softwares or tomography data.
This software uses Tortuosity estimator developed by Professor Nakashima Yoshito Home Page: <https://staff.aist.go.jp/nakashima.yoshito/index-e.htm>. Link to the Program download <https://staff.aist.go.jp/nakashima.yoshito/progeng.htm>. Tortuosity estimator uses random walk method to estimate effective diffusivity from which tortuosity is estinated. The citation for the original paper is followed.
